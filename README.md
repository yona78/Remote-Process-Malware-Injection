# Remote-Process-Malware-Injection
In this project, I engaged in an extensive exploration of malware techniques. I initiated the process by injecting a DLL into the Notepad process, a foundational aspect of code injection. I then proceeded to manipulate the Import Address Table (IAT) using IAT hooking techniques, redirecting the behavior of the "CreateFile" function. To enhance the project's capabilities, I established a socket connection, enabling remote communication with a server. 
In the final phase, the program accomplishes reporting to the server each time a user creates or saves a file within the Notepad application.
